We’re building an application for watching the price of various stocks. 
There are two places in our application where we need to display the stocks:  

1. StatusBar: shows the popular stocks  
2. StockListView: shows the complete list of stocks 


When the price of a stock changes, the corresponding views (StatusBar and/or StockListView) need to be refreshed to reflect the latest price.  
Our application currently does not have the ability to communicate the change in stock prices to the corresponding views.  
Use the observer pattern to solve this problem.
